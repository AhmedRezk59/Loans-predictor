## Overview

The Loans Prediction Project leverages various machine learning algorithms to predict whether a loan application will be approved. The dataset includes features such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and more.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Support for multiple ML algorithms
- Performance metrics and visualization

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AhmedRezk59/Loans-predictor.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in the expected format.
2. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
3. Review the output and model performance metrics.
